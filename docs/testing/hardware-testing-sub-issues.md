## Summary

These 16 sub-issues provide a comprehensive roadmap for implementing the hardware testing strategy. Each issue is designed to be independently valuable while contributing to the overall goal of making hardware testing as convenient and reliable as mock testing.

The phased approach ensures we deliver value early while building toward a complete solution that embraces the "hardware truth" philosophy.
