# Sub-Issue: GPIO Virtual State Machine Implementation

## Title
Implement GPIO Virtual State Machine for Hardware-Free Testing

## Description
Create a comprehensive GPIO mock that simulates all GPIO operations with nanosecond precision, including pin states, edge detection, interrupts, and electrical characteristics.

## Background
As part of the Hardware Mock-Driven Testing Strategy (#28), we need a GPIO virtual state machine that can:
- Simulate pin states without hardware
- Provide sub-microsecond timing accuracy
- Enable testing of edge cases impossible on real hardware

## Requirements

### Core Features
- [ ] Pin state management (HIGH/LOW/FLOATING/PULL_UP/PULL_DOWN)
- [ ] Edge detection (RISING/FALLING/BOTH)
- [ ] Interrupt simulation with priority levels
- [ ] Debounce timing simulation
- [ ] Multi-pin operations (parallel reads/writes)

### Timing Requirements
- [ ] State transitions < 100ns
- [ ] Edge detection latency < 50ns
- [ ] Interrupt delivery < 200ns
- [ ] Deterministic timing mode for CI/CD

### Failure Injection
- [ ] Floating pin behavior
- [ ] Pull resistor failures
- [ ] Voltage level violations
- [ ] Glitch injection
- [ ] Race condition simulation

### Integration
- [ ] Drop-in replacement for RPi.GPIO
- [ ] Compatible with existing test infrastructure
- [ ] Redis event generation
- [ ] Performance metrics collection

## Technical Approach

### State Machine Design
```python
class GPIOStateMachine:
    states = {
        'UNINITIALIZED': ['INPUT', 'OUTPUT'],
        'INPUT': ['OUTPUT', 'CLEANUP'],
        'OUTPUT': ['INPUT', 'CLEANUP'],
        'CLEANUP': ['UNINITIALIZED']
    }
```

### Performance Optimization
- Use `time.perf_counter_ns()` for timing
- Pre-allocate state arrays
- Lock-free data structures for multi-threaded access
- Memory-mapped virtual registers

### Testing the Mock
1. Timing accuracy tests
2. State transition verification
3. Interrupt latency measurement
4. Concurrent access stress tests
5. Memory leak detection

## Implementation Tasks

1. **Core State Machine** (2 days)
   - Basic state tracking
   - State transition logic
   - Thread safety

2. **Timing Engine** (1 day)
   - Nanosecond resolution timers
   - Event scheduling
   - Deterministic mode

3. **Edge Detection** (1 day)
   - Rising/falling edge detection
   - Debounce simulation
   - Interrupt queueing

4. **Failure Injection** (1 day)
   - Fault injection API
   - Common failure patterns
   - Chaos testing support

5. **Integration** (1 day)
   - RPi.GPIO compatibility layer
   - Test migration
   - Documentation

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All existing GPIO tests pass with mock
- [ ] Mock operations 100x faster than hardware
- [ ] Zero memory leaks over 1M operations
- [ ] Can simulate 10+ failure modes
- [ ] Documentation with examples

## Dependencies
- Python 3.11+ (for nanosecond timers)
- No external dependencies (pure Python)

## Estimated Effort
6 developer days
