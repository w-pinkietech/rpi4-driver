# Design Documentation

This directory contains all design and architecture documentation for the RPi4 Interface Drivers project.

## ðŸ“š Document Index

### Core Architecture
- **[DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md)** - Main design document with detailed architecture specifications
- **[FINAL_ARCHITECTURE.md](FINAL_ARCHITECTURE.md)** - Complete system design and implementation rationale
- **[MICROSERVICES_ARCHITECTURE.md](MICROSERVICES_ARCHITECTURE.md)** - Security-first microservices architecture design

### Plug & Play System
- **[PLUGPLAY.md](PLUGPLAY.md)** - Zero-configuration plug & play system overview
- **[PLUGPLAY_IMPLEMENTATION.md](PLUGPLAY_IMPLEMENTATION.md)** - Technical implementation details for plug & play
- **[CUSTOM_PROTOCOLS.md](CUSTOM_PROTOCOLS.md)** - Custom protocol support and 70% auto-detection system

### Design Reviews
- **[ARCHITECTURE_REVIEW.md](ARCHITECTURE_REVIEW.md)** - Architecture review and design decisions
- **[REVIEW_RESPONSE.md](REVIEW_RESPONSE.md)** - Responses to architecture review feedback

## ðŸŽ¯ Design Principles

1. **Security First** - Minimal privileged code (<50 lines)
2. **Zero Configuration** - True plug & play operation
3. **Universal Compatibility** - 100% raw data passthrough guarantee
4. **Scalability** - Microservices architecture for independent scaling
5. **Extensibility** - Support for custom protocols and community sharing

## ðŸ“‹ Reading Order

For new developers, we recommend reading the documents in this order:

1. **DESIGN.md** - Start with the overall design
2. **MICROSERVICES_ARCHITECTURE.md** - Understand the architecture approach
3. **PLUGPLAY.md** - Learn about the plug & play system
4. **FINAL_ARCHITECTURE.md** - See the complete implementation
5. **ARCHITECTURE_REVIEW.md** - Understand design decisions and trade-offs
