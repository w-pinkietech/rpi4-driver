- Network of emulated devices
- Protocol analyzers built-in

### Integration Potential
- Could use Renode's peripheral models as reference
- Their time control API is excellent inspiration
- Robot framework integration patterns

### Limitations

## 6. Open-Source Libraries to Leverage

### For Timing
```python
# pytest-benchmark for performance assertions
def test_gpio_performance(benchmark):
    gpio = MockGPIO()
    result = benchmark(gpio.read_pin, 17)
    assert benchmark.stats['mean'] < 100e-9  # 100ns
```

### For State Machines
```python
# transitions library for complex state machines
from transitions import Machine

class I2CStateMachine(Machine):
    states = ['idle', 'start', 'address', 'data', 'stop']
    
    def __init__(self):
        Machine.__init__(self, states=self.states, initial='idle')
        self.add_transition('send_start', 'idle', 'start')
```

### For Protocol Analysis
```python
# scapy-inspired packet construction
class I2CFrame:
    def __init__(self, address, data, read=False):
        self.address = address
        self.read = read
        self.data = data
    
    def __bytes__(self):
        addr_byte = (self.address << 1) | (1 if self.read else 0)
        return bytes([addr_byte] + list(self.data))
```

## 7. Performance Comparison

| Solution | Setup Time | Per-Op Latency | Failure Modes | Language |
|----------|------------|----------------|---------------|----------|
| QEMU | Minutes | Milliseconds | Limited | C |
